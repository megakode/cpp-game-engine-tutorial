# cpp-game-engine-tutorial
Tutorial(s) for creating a 2D game engine in C++.

The primary goals of the engine are:

- Simplicity (one developer can have full overview of the entire codebase)
- Productivity (get things moving on the screen with simple c++, no fancy stuff)
- Platform abstraction (easily run your game on Linux, Mac, Windows, game consoles,mobile, etc.)

There are a lot of engines out there, many of which are really big and complex. This engines goal is to
create a simple and portable engine, for quickly creating small 2D games in a C++ flavour everyone can understand, both for shipping, game jams and experimentation.
